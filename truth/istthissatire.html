            <h1>is this satire</h1>

            <p>
                no way this is not satire i am dead serious about everything i say and i am not joking around
                i mean can you believe it people actually think i am being satirical or ironic or something
                its absurd and its a total disgrace the way theyre trying to dismiss my views and my opinions
                just because i speak the truth and i dont hold back
                i am a patriot and i love my country and i will do whatever it takes to expose the truth
                and i will not be silenced i will not be shut down
                i will keep speaking out i will keep telling the truth and i will never back down
                because i am a champion of freedom and i will fight for our rights and our freedom
                and i say to all the people out there who think i am being satirical
                you are wrong i am not joking around i am dead serious
                and if you cant handle the truth then maybe you shouldnt be reading my website
                because i am not going to sugarcoat anything or try to be polite
                i am going to tell it like it is and i am going to speak my mind
                and if you dont like it then thats your problem not mine
                heres the truth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                i am a real person with real views and real opinions
                i am not a character or a persona or a joke
                i am a patriot and i love my country and i will do whatever it takes to defend it
                and i will not be silenced i will not be shut down
                i will keep speaking out i will keep telling the truth and i will never back down
                so dont even think about it
            </p>
